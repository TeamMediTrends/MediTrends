# MediTrends - Senior Project Proposal

## 1. Project Name
**MediTrends**

## 2. Group Size / Contact Information
- **Blake Torres**  
  - Email: blaketorres2000@gmail.com  

- **Kimberly Torres**  
  - Email: kimtorres2005@gmail.com  

## 3. Abstract / Purpose
MediTrends aims to analyze and visualize trends in medical data from simulated patients.  
The project will provide the ability to sift through large datasets and identify patterns within the data.  
For example, it will help track trends such as glucose levels in a specific age group.  
Users can either search for specific trends or explore trends within defined categories.  

## 4. Background / Prior Knowledge
- Both team members work in the medical field and aim to use this project as a demonstration that they can be a great fit for research analysis.
- Some experience with **Django** and **Python**, but excited to learn more about data analysis.
- The goal is to make medical data **clear, understandable, and actionable** for doctors and researchers.
- Django’s ability to integrate the backend and frontend makes it an ideal framework.
- While we lack extensive training in mathematical data analysis, our main focus is on **presenting medical data effectively**.

### **Why?**
We aim to showcase our ability to transform complex medical data into **meaningful insights** for healthcare professionals.  
By developing MediTrends, we strive to prove to research teams that we can present large amounts of medical data in an **intuitive and accessible way**.

### **What?**
- MediTrends will analyze **thousands of patient records spanning a five year period**.
- Data includes **medical panels, demographic factors, and test results**.
- The application will generate **clear visualizations** to help non-technical users (doctors, researchers) detect trends easily.
- Unlike many data applications, MediTrends will prioritize **user-friendly, insightful visualizations**.

### **Who?**
- **Primary users**: Doctors, researchers, and healthcare professionals.
- **Evaluators**: Our instructor and prospective employers in medical research.
- **Potential additional users**: Small clinics, community health programs, medical educators.

### **Where?**
- **Development**: VS Code, Python, Django.
- **Deployment**: (https://meditrenz.azurewebsites.net/)

### **How?**
- **Database**: SQLite for storing patient data.
- **Backend**: Python scripts for statistical analysis, correlation patterns, and anomaly detection.
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas for data processing.
- **Frontend**: Django templates (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for visualizations using **Chart.js, Plotly**.
- **Security**: Django authentication for restricted access.
- **Development Approach**: Start with a basic functional site, then iterate with more advanced features.

### **When?**
**Project Completion Criteria:**
- **Core functionality**: Essential analytics and visualizations are functioning as expected.
- **Security measures**: User authentication is implemented.
- **Clear insights**: Non-technical users can easily understand and navigate the data.
- **SMART Goals**:
  - **Specific**: Clearly defined features.
  - **Measurable**: Implemented trends and charts.
  - **Achievable**: Realistic scope.
  - **Relevant**: Demonstrates our skills to potential employers.
  - **Time-bound**: Milestones for database setup, core Django features, visualizations, and testing.

Once these milestones are reached, **MediTrends will be live and ready for demonstration**.

## 6. Significance
- MediTrends addresses a **real healthcare challenge**: making raw medical data **practical and applicable**.
- Full-stack web application using Django, SQLite, and JavaScript visualization libraries.
- **Real-world impact**: Potential use in clinical and research settings.
- **Portfolio value**: Demonstrates ability to manage backend logic, data analysis, and frontend presentation.
- **Future potential**: Could evolve into a commercial product for small clinics and research teams.

## 7. New Computer Science Concepts
- **Django Class-Based Views** for organizing backend logic.
- **Middleware Development** for logging, security, and request handling.
- **Django Signals** for event-driven actions (e.g., notifications when new data is added).
- **Data Visualization Libraries**: Deep dive into **Plotly, Bokeh** for interactive charts.
- **Pandas for Data Handling**: Extensive use for analyzing large medical datasets.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Learning about **rolling averages, moving windows, and Statsmodels**.

This project will push us beyond our previous coursework and deepen our understanding of full-stack development and data science.

## 8. Interesting Aspects
- **Passion for Python**: Python’s structure is valuable in our eyes because of its real-world applications in data analysis, making us eager to learn all that we can.
- **Excitement for frontend development**: We enjoy making our work come to life in a browser.
- **Healthcare Background**: We have spent **23+ years (Blake) and 15+ years (Kimberly) in the medical field**, and we want to continue using our expertise in a technical role.
- **Real-World Impact**: This project isn’t just an assignment for us, it is a stepping stone to a **career**.

---

We are excited to develop **MediTrends** and see how it can bridge the gap between complex medical data and meaningful healthcare insights.
